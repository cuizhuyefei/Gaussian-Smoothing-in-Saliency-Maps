# Gaussian-Smoothing-in-Saliency-Maps

`two_split.py` is for training two neural networks on two disjoint splits of the training set.

`saliency_diff_plot_sigma.py` is to draw the figure of stability error with different sigmas.

`fidelity_plot_sigma.py` is to draw the figure of fidelity error with different sigmas.

`saliency_diff.py` is to calculate the metrics of SSIM and top-k mIoU.
